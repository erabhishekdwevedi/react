# Spread Attribute OR Three Dots ...

# Spread Attribute is simple way of writing full array

### Definition

Spread syntax allows an iterable 
such as an array expression or string to be expanded
in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or 
elements (for array literals) are expected, or 
an object expression to be expanded 
in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.


### Simple Example
```
const people = ["Abhishek","Ashish"];
console.log(...people); 
```
